  - text: Don't you understand? I am telling you the truth.
  - text: This thing just wants to use you. It hurt you!
  - text: It's literally sucking the life out of you!
  - text: Get out of here while you still can before it's too late.
  - text: But if I don't merge with God, I won't matter!
  - text: I never thought I'd say this, but Danny you actually do matter to A LOT
      of people.
  - text: Everyone at school admires you, and to tell you the truth, I've been jealous
      of that.
  - text: Merging with this thing isn't going to make you feel like you matter.
  - text: Maybe not.
  - text: I NEED YOUR FLESH.
  - text: GIVE IT TO ME.
  - text: IT HURTS.
  - text: Get away Danny! It's acting weird!
  - text: I think I'm gonna skedaddle.
